            <p className="text-gray-900">
              Hello! My name is Landon Kimber! I am 21 years old and from Ogden,
              Utah. I was born and raised in Ogden and have lived here my entire
              life so naturally I came to love every corner of the city and
              every acre of the country surrounding it. I graduated from Ogden
              High School, as the president of the National Honors Society and
              lettering in basketball. After high school, I finished my general
              associates degree with Weber State University and am currently
              enrolled in University of Utah's EdEx coding bootcamp. I really
              enjoy coding and the challenge and problem solving that comes with
              it! When I have freetime away from school and work, being from
              Utah, I very much enjoy being outdoors and everything that comes
              with it. Some of my favorite hobbies outdoors include, hiking,
              fly-fishing, skiing, backpacking, camping, and anything else
              that'll let me breathe the cold fresh mountain air. Aside's from
              outdoors, I do also very much enjoy watching the NBA, playing
              video games, but most of all, sleeping! Please take a look around
              this site for references for my current work and progress within
              the beautiful world of web development!
            </p>

              Experience
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              While my experience is limited, having never worked in the tech
              industry, I did graduate from the University of Utah fuhll stack
              web development bootcamp. I have learned a lot about coding and
              web development in the past 6 months and am excited to continue
              learning and growing in the field. Through the bootcamp, I have
              experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL,
              MongoDB, React, and other technologies. I have also learned a lot
              about working with others and collaborating on projects. I am
              excited to continue learning and growing in the field and am
              excited to see where my career takes me!
